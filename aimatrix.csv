Under A., 1. it reads: ""Caused by ""your work"" performed for that additional insured that is the subject of the written contract or written agreement; and"", this language limits the scope of the AI endorsement to just the specific work in the contract.  So any additional work or work deemed outside the scope of the contract will not be covered.  This concerns us since there is almost always work done on site that was not contemplated by the contract or the owner request additional work to be done again that is not memorialized in the contract.

5. Under E., 1., b. and c. it reads:  b. Tender the defense and indemnity of any claim or ""suit"" to all insurers whom also have insurance available to the additional insured; and c. Agree to make available any other insurance which the additional insured has for a loss we cover under this Coverage Part.  And while there is language further along in the endorsement related to amending the Other Insurance clause to extend the AI status on primary and non-contributory basis, this only applies if the named insured has agreed in the written contract to provide that status.  If the requirement is not in the written contract, then these sections apply and in essence defeats the basic intent of additional insured status of risk transfer to the responsible party (in this case the named insured).
